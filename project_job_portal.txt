EXPLAINING THE PROJECTS -> 
I have made a job portal application using mern stack and for database I have used mongo-db 

this application has 2 version of usage 

first version is for EMPLOYEER 
EMPLOYEER comes on the job portal and first they create there account and than they can create a job opening and post the same job opening on this application. 
they are allowed to post multiple job openings. 
EMPLOYEER can also modify there posted job and set there expiration date. 
and EMPLOYEER have the functionalities of viewing that which all applicants have applied for the posted application and 
thus they can filter out the suitable candidates by viewing there applications.


second version is for JOB-SEEKEER 
JOB-SEEKER comes on this portal and create there accounts first Now I have made use of JWT To make sure user Authentication features are applied here.

****** NOW, TELL ABOUT JWT TOKENS? WHAT IS IT AND WHAT ARE ITS ADVANTAGES ********
